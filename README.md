## INTRODUCTION

The Administration Menu module displays the entire administrative menu tree
(and most local tasks) in a drop-down menu, providing administrators one- or
two-click access to most pages.  Other modules may also add menu links to the
menu using hook_admin_menu_output_alter().

* For a full description of the module, visit the project page:
  https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_menu

* To submit bug reports and feature suggestions, or track changes:
  https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/admin_menu


## REQUIREMENTS

This module requires the following modules:

* Views (https://www.drupal.org/project/views)
* Panels (https://www.drupal.org/project/panels)


## RECOMMENDED

* Markdown filter (https://www.drupal.org/project/markdown):
  When enabled, display of the project's README.md help will be rendered
  with markdown.


## INSTALLATION
 
* Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. Visit
  https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7 for
  further information.

* You may want to disable Toolbar module, since its output clashes with
  Administration Menu.


## CONFIGURATION
 
* Configure the user permissions in Administration » People » Permissions:

  - Use the administration pages and help (System module)

    The top-level administration categories require this permission to be
    accessible. The administration menu will be empty unless this permission
    is granted.

  - Access administration menu

    Users with this permission will see the administration menu at the top of
    each page.

  - Display Drupal links

    Users with this permission will receive links to drupal.org issue queues for
    all enabled contributed modules. The issue queue links appear under the
    administration menu icon.

* Customize the menu settings in Administration » Configuration and modules »
  Administration » Administration menu.

* To prevent administrative menu items from appearing twice, you may hide the
  "Management" menu block.


## CONFIGURATION

The module has no menu or modifiable settings. There is no configuration. When
enabled, the module will prevent the links from appearing. To get the links
back, disable the module and clear caches.


## TROUBLESHOOTING

* If the menu does not display, check the following:

  - Are the "Access administration menu" and "Use the administration pages and
    help" permissions enabled for the appropriate roles?

  - Does html.tpl.php of your theme output the $page_bottom variable?


## FAQ

Q: I enabled "Aggregate and compress CSS files", but admin_menu.css is still
   there. Is this normal?

A: Yes, this is the intended behavior. the administration menu module only loads
   its stylesheet as needed (i.e., on page requests by logged-on, administrative
   users).
